--The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
--12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
--
--The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
--(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
--
--Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
