1. About
-----

This are my solutions for the awesome [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/).

I try to make solutions in [Lua](http://www.lua.org), [MoonScript](http://moonscript.org), [C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29) and [Python](http://www.python.org) in that order, so problem 1 is in Lua, problem 2 is in MoonScript and so on.

2. TODO
-----

* 15 -> C
* 23 -> C
* 25 -> Lua
* 26 -> MoonScript
* 27 -> C
* 28 -> Python

* 29 -> Lua:
    - Fix algorithm to better deal with floating point.
