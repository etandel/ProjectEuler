1. About
-----

This are my solutions for the awesome [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/).

I try to make solutions in [Lua](http://www.lua.org), [MoonScript](http://moonscript.org), [C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29) and [Python](http://www.python.org) in that order, so problem 1 is in Lua, problem 2 is in MoonScript and so on.

2. TODO
-----
- Implement:
    * 15 -> C
    * 26 -> MoonScript
    * 28 -> Python

- Fix:
    * 29 -> Lua: Fix algorithm to better deal with floating point.
